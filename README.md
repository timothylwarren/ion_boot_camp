# ion_boot_camp

This repository was used for one-day boot camp for incoming Institute of Neuroscience
graduate students on 9.14.19. The boot camp featured work and data generated in Chris Doe's lab
http://www.doelab.org/ and was led by Timothy Warren and Brandon Mark.

This repository has two parts: imaging and connectivity.

In imaging subfolder, jupyter notebook files (.ipynb) include 
both the planned routines "boot_camp_planned.ipynb"
to read in .tif files from 2-photon Ca +2 imaging experiments,
as well as the actual jupyter notebook files created in interactive demos in morning and afternoon.
("python_morning.ipynb","python_afternoon.ipynb")

In connectivity subfolder, 
"Bootcamp_planned.ipynb" shows planned exercises related to analysis of EM data.
"morning_connectivity.ipynb" is actual jupyter notebook used.
